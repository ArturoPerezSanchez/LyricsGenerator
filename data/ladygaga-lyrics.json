her\nI try to provoke her by giving money and jewelry and accessories\nInstead of the recipe with a legacy of taking her to another place when I get it\n\nHold up\nTwista be going in warp speed breaking atoms\nBlowing O.G. has got me creating antimatter\nLet her pop it and smoke on it with me now\nI got her because she ready to party and then move to the club\nBecause you know the way I think is an anomaly\nAnd I'm 'a be strange as Lady Gaga\nProbably\nA dollar be the business\nBut I'd rather be in an outer dimension when I be talking about jewels and drugs\n\nJewels and drugs, play

stared\nWhile my eyes filled up with tears, but there was nothing there\nNo, no, nothing\n\nI heard one sine from above\nI heard one sine from above\nThen the signal split in two\nThe sound created stars like me and you\nBefore there was love, there was silence\nI heard one sine\nAnd it healed my heart, heard a sine\n\nHealed my heart, heard a sine\nHealed my heart, heard a sine\n\nWhen I was
